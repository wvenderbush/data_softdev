# State Fragility Index Graphic Website

## Our Goal
The goal of this project is to graphically portray data about the State Fragility Index.
We will be using a Python library from the [CORGIS Data Set](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/python/state_fragility/state_fragility.html) to pull and portray data about the countries of the world and the stability of their governments starting in 1995 and going until 2014. 

## Our Plan
We plan to show the data using growing and shrinking bubbles. The bubbles will be colored with the flags of the countries to show which country each bubble represents. The larger the bubble the more stable the country is (ie. the SFI is closer to 0). 

There will be a hover-over slider at the top of the page to allow the user to move through the years (1995-2014). As the user moves the mouse, the bubbles will grow/shrink based on their SFI data.

Countries will be displayed randomly, in an appropriate number to fit the screen.
